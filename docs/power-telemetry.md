# GPU Power Telemetry (`dcgm-power`)

The `dcgm-power` telemetry provider records raw per-GPU watts for every
allocated worker node, the topology needed to map each GPU to a `prefill`,
`decode`, or `agg` role, and the exact formal benchmark window for every
measured concurrency. It never integrates power into energy and never branches
on model, precision, or recipe; consumers integrate watts over the recorded
window themselves.

## How it works

- One DCGM exporter task runs on each allocated worker node, launched through
  the normal SLURM/process-registry path (one `srun` per heterogeneous group).
- A collector thread inside the orchestrator polls every exporter concurrently
  from the physical head node, so all sample timestamps and benchmark
  boundaries come from one clock.
- Only `DCGM_FI_DEV_POWER_USAGE` is parsed. Device identity comes from the
  `gpu` and `UUID` labels.
- **No in-tree benchmark stamps measurement windows yet**, so every run is
  currently unpublishable: it records `MEASUREMENT_WINDOW` reason codes, and
  `required: true` exits non-zero. The adapter belongs with the benchmark
  (for the current sa-bench path and its planned replacement alike): the
  benchmark child writes one window file per measured concurrency using the
  standalone `measurement_window.py` module and the windows directory passed
  in via `MEASUREMENT_WINDOW_DIR_ENV`.

## Configuration

```yaml
# NOTE: unsupported end-to-end until a benchmark adapter stamps windows —
# with this exact config every run is unpublishable and `required: true` fails.
benchmark:
  type: sa-bench          # future benchmark-side adapter must stamp the windows
  client_placement: head  # keeps sample and window clocks on one host
  isl: 8192
  osl: 1024
  concurrencies: [4]

telemetry:
  enabled: true
  provider: dcgm-power
  collect_interval_ms: 1000         # target interval for each endpoint; must be <= 3000
  storage_subdir: power             # relative to the run log directory
  required: true                    # exit non-zero when artifacts are unpublishable
  startup_timeout_seconds: 30
  request_timeout_seconds: 2
  collector_join_timeout_seconds: 12
  dcgm_exporter:
    container_image: dcgm-exporter  # alias, path, or registry URI
    port: 9401
```

`dcgm-power` needs **only** `dcgm_exporter`. Unlike `provider: scraper` it does
not require the top-level `container_image` or a `node_exporter`, because the
collector runs inside srtctl. Config loading validates the block and rejects
inconsistent values with actionable messages; in particular
`collect_interval_ms` must not exceed three seconds. Each endpoint runs on an
independent fixed schedule, so a slow node cannot delay healthy nodes and an
endpoint never starts a second request while its previous request is in
flight. A due slot still fires late while it remains inside its interval; only
fully elapsed slots are marked missed. Shutdown chooses one shared final slot
for every endpoint, so an endpoint that was in flight cannot leave schedule
holes or close on an earlier slot than its peers.

Coverage validation derives its normal gap budget from the recorded sample
interval plus twice the request timeout (the connect and read timeout phases).
For long measurement windows it tolerates a bounded overrun up to 10 seconds
when one gap covers at most 0.5% and all gaps over that configured budget cover
at most 5% of the window. Missing brackets, larger gaps, and sustained data
loss still fail `sample_gap_exceeded`. Telemetry stays disabled by default and
existing `provider: scraper` recipes are unchanged.
The collector join timeout must exceed two complete request-cycle budgets
(`2 * (2 * request_timeout_seconds + 1 second)`), covering a scrape already in
flight when shutdown starts plus the final bracketing scrape.

## Artifacts

```text
<log_dir>/<storage_subdir>/
├── manifest.json
├── samples.csv
├── scrape-timings.jsonl
└── windows/
    └── <benchmark-result-stem>.json
```

`scrape-timings.jsonl` is optional diagnostic evidence, excluded from publication
validation. Each endpoint record joins samples by `hostname` and `scrape_seq`
and includes the job/run identity, request start/end, HTTP status or exception,
sample timestamp, parse duration, scheduling lag, sample-writer lock wait and
CSV write/flush duration. Scheduling lag is null for manual `collect_once()`
calls, which have no fixed schedule. Failed requests retain timing even though
they produce no sample; the manifest's maximum successful scrape duration
keeps its existing meaning.

Only a daemon writes this sidecar, through a queue capped at 128 records.
Queue overflow drops diagnostics, never power samples. A final
`diagnostic_summary` reports the number dropped. A missing summary means the
sidecar may be incomplete, including file failure or a blocked write/close.
Diagnostic I/O holds no sample-writer lock and shutdown waits only within the
collector's existing deadline. Sample-write failures retain the existing
collector failure behavior; diagnostics do not make invalid data publishable.

`samples.csv` has the exact header
`schema_version,timestamp_unix,scrape_seq,hostname,gpu_index,gpu_uuid,power_w`,
one row per observation, `(scrape_seq, hostname, gpu_index)` unique. Rows are
never interpolated, averaged, or role-attributed — role and heterogeneous
group live once in the manifest topology.

`manifest.json` records producer identity (version, git commit, exporter image
and its SHA-256), the sample interval, expected and observed device sets, the
topology mapping, the expected window list, the SHA-256 of the finalized
`samples.csv` bytes, terminal status, per-window coverage validation, and
reason codes. It also records `missed_sample_count` and compact ranges with the
endpoint, exact scrape sequence range, scheduled timestamps, and cause.
`scrape_count` is the elapsed slot high-water mark (the greatest scheduled
`scrape_seq` plus one), so it includes both sampled and missed slots rather
than counting HTTP requests. To bound manifest size during alternating
success/failure patterns, at most 64 missed ranges are retained;
`missed_sample_count` remains exact and `missed_sample_ranges_truncated=true`
states when later range details were omitted.
`status` is the lifecycle outcome;
`publication_valid` is the separate publication gate. Reason codes are stable
machine-readable strings enumerated in `srtctl/core/power/contract.py`.
The digest is required for offline publication validation, so packages created
before `samples_sha256` was recorded cannot be certified by this validator.

A window file records the formal benchmark boundaries on the head-node Unix
clock plus a monotonic `duration`, and points at the SA-Bench result it
brackets; result and window are boundary-identical.

With `required: true`, all artifacts are written first and the job then exits
non-zero whenever the terminal manifest is not publishable. With
`required: false`, measurement invalidity leaves the benchmark exit code
unchanged; an operational failure — a collector that cannot be joined, a
benchmark child that cannot be reaped, or an internal error while finalizing
telemetry — fails the job in either mode.

On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` or a critical-process death, the shared process registry
tears processes down before the collector finalizes, so the final scrape sees
dead endpoints. The manifest fails closed (`exporter_exited` /
`collector_interrupted` force `publication_valid=false`); the cost is that a
job that was simply cancelled can record `exporter_exited`.

## Re-validating a retained run

The artifact package is self-describing. The manifest supplies producer
identity, expected topology, runtime-only failure history, and a stored
verdict; the validator does not trust that verdict on its own:

```bash
srtctl-validate-power \
  --power-dir outputs/12345/logs/power \
  --result-root outputs/12345/logs \
  --expect-role prefill=4 --expect-role decode=4 \
  --require-distinct-het-groups
```

It recomputes every disk-derived claim from `samples.csv`, the result files,
and `windows/`, then requires the stored disk-derived reason subset and
`publication_valid` verdict to agree. Runtime-only reasons such as HTTP,
exporter-process, and collector failures cannot be reconstructed after the
live job is gone, so they are checked for a known v1 enum value and lifecycle
consistency instead. Exit status is `0` only when the recomputed package is
publishable, the stored verdict is `true`, and the two agree; otherwise it is
`1` and every failure is printed. The `--expect-*` flags optionally assert an
expected job shape for hardware canaries.
